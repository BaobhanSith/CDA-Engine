# CDA

The Offical Git Repo for the CDA Engine!

CDA stands for Create, Develop, Achive. That's something that I want users of this engine to do. Create ideas. Develop those ideas. Achive their goals.

I've never made a game engine before and as such, I'm following a YouTube tutorial series by TheChernoProject. I highly recommend you check his channel out if you wish to do the same. Due to me following his series, there will be a lot of similarities, more so at the start of development. Over time, however, this will change as the engine begins to take shape and become its own thing.

Over the course of development, I'll be getting opinions and ideas from budding game developers and trying my best to incorporate them into the CDA Engine. Feedback and suggestions are welcome and you can contact me on discord at "Programmer Crabo#8295".

Make sure to stay tuned for more progress! I'll be showing progress off in the Virtus Learning Hub (https://discord.gg/hs37bev) and the Indie Uprising (https://discord.gg/tkfjPXn) discord servers.

CURRENT ENGINE VERSION: 0.0.1 (NO VISIBLE PROGRESS)
